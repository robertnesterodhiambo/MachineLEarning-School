# Manual 2D Convolution Layer in TensorFlow/Keras

This project implements a custom 2D convolution layer in TensorFlow/Keras without using the built-in convolution functions. The `ManualConv2d` class provides a straightforward implementation of the convolution operation, which can be useful for educational purposes and understanding how convolutional layers work internally.
