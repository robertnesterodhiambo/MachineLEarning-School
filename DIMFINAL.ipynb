    "# PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail companies, in their pursuit of unraveling the intricacies of customer behavior, have been striving to understand consumption patterns and improve predictive capabilities. In this endeavor, my primary objective is to develop a comprehensive predictive model that delves into the diverse customer base, anticipating the specific products they are likely to purchase. Utilizing a robust dataset encompassing extensive customer details, product information, and historical order data, the goal is to discern nuanced patterns and trends that drive purchasing decisions. The predictive model will intricately incorporate various factors, including customer demographics, order history, and product attributes. To elevate the model's performance, sophisticated feature engineering techniques will be explored, ensuring the creation of pertinent features that contribute to enhanced prediction accuracy. The overarching ambition is to furnish actionable insights empowering marketing and sales teams with targeted product recommendations, optimizing customer satisfaction and maximizing sales opportunities. This predictive analytics endeavor stands as a pivotal step toward unlocking the full potential of business intelligence, fostering informed decision-making, and driving sustained growth in a dynamic market landscape.\n"
