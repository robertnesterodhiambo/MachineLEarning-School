    "1. **Question:** How do I install TensorFlow using pip?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** You can install TensorFlow using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install tensorflow\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question:** What is the basic structure of a neural network in TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Here's a simple example of a neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "   model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "       tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_size,)),\n",
    "       tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n",
    "   ])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Question:** How can I load and preprocess an image dataset with TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** TensorFlow provides tools for loading and preprocessing images, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image_dataset_from_directory\n",
    "\n",
    "   dataset = image_dataset_from_directory(directory_path)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Question:** Can I use TensorFlow for non-neural network tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Yes, TensorFlow is a versatile library. You can use it for a wide range of tasks, including traditional machine learning and even some non-machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Question:** What is eager execution in TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Eager execution allows operations to be evaluated immediately as they are called. It makes TensorFlow more interactive and intuitive. You can enable eager execution with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Question:** How do I train a simple neural network with TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Here's a basic example of training a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n",
    "   model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Question:** What is the purpose of the TensorFlow Hub library?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** TensorFlow Hub is a repository of pre-trained machine learning models. It allows you to reuse and transfer existing models for your specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Question:** How do I save and load a trained TensorFlow model?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** You can save and load a model using the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   model.save('my_model')\n",
    "   loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Question:** Can I use TensorFlow with GPUs to accelerate training?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Yes, TensorFlow provides GPU support. You can install the GPU version and TensorFlow will automatically utilize available GPUs for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Question:** What is TensorFlow Lite, and how is it used for mobile applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and edge devices. It allows you to deploy machine learning models on mobile devices efficiently. You can convert a trained TensorFlow model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment."
